### First Release

This is the first version of my Destiny 2 Knowledge Quiz - a small personal side-project that I've been working on lately. It is built on React.js, and uses a react-quiz-component framework.


### Future Development

For now, there is just one static quiz - that's it. In the future, I would like to add randomization to the questions, as well as create new quizzes to sort - for example: armor, mods, lore, etc. For now, these are just ideas.

## Known Issues

- Does not work on mobile! At least, "small mobile". Please view on a tablet or computer for best results!
- "Next Question" button may appear off-screen on low resolutions for certain questions.
    - If this is the case, please zoom out to click the button. (You can zoom back in afterwards)
